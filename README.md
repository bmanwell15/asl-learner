# ASL Learner App
Our initial challenge we started with was Advance Personalized Learning. We started off with the idea that there is a lack of engagement within our generation because of technology exposure, which led us to wanting to create something that would help people learn or gain a new skill. There was a lot of jumping back and forth between what we wanted to do, but we felt inspired by the deaf community and loved ones of people with hearing problems. So, that led us to creating something that would allow people to learn ASL. There are lots of people out there that don’t know ASL but have loved ones that are deaf, so we wanted to create something that would encourage them to learn ASL even with the tight schedule they might have. We think this product can help out a lot of people and engage them to strive in order to learn a new language!

The final product we have is an ASL learning app, that uses motion detection in order to confirm or deny if the user is doing the sign correctly. It has unlockable reviews (as you progress through the app) and practice tools that will help engage the user and apply their learning, to further enforce the ideas. Once you get into a lesson, the screen is prompted with a camera which allows the user to see themselves, as well as a graphic of the hand symbol placed over the camera. This allows the user to see themselves and ensure they are doing the right symbol. Once they have lined up their hand with the reflection in the camera, the program checks it as correct and moves onto the next letter. The first lesson consists of the alphabet, then unlocks the second lesson which forces the user to spell out words with the letters they have learned. 

We knew this project would be pretty time consuming, so we hit the ground running pretty early on. Our first prototype is what we have now, but we have worked to perfect it every day.

Our feedback we received was mostly positive. There was feedback we got back that we had already accounted for, such as “what about the inverted camera on right hand/left hand?” which we had already programmed the app to recognize both the left and right hands. There were a couple things our peers suggested we add, such as lesson reminders (similar to Duolingo) or adding live feedback for the user to improve their sign, which are both great ideas. If we continue to further develop this app, we will definitely take these suggestions into account.

## Setup

### Installing the Correct Python Version
The AI Model for this app using Tensorflow and Mediapipe. Because Mediapipe only works for a selected version of python, **this project uses Python Version 3.8.10**.
